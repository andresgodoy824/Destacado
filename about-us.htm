    <p class="about-text">Destacado Car Detailing started off in 2021 as a way of making extra income. When we first started we had never detailed a car before. Liam and I (Andres) first got the business going, but quickly found out we would need more help to deal with all the clients we were getting. Since starting the company we have grown esponentially and expanded to the Lancaster area, where I (Andres) attend college. This past year this has become much more than a side hustle and we hope to continue to grow in the coming years. Starting Destacado has taught us a lot about business and that it is more about serving our clients than it is about making money for ourselves. We strive to provide the most value to our customers through our effecient, affordable, and convinient service. We offer <a class="services-link" href="interior.html">interior</a>, <a class="services-link" href="exterior.html">exterior</a>, and complete details right in your driveway. </p>
